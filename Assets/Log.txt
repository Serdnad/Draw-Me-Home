 * UPDATE: ok, so im not using the log as much as i first saw myself doing so... (not at all). so im just gonna throw any notes to myself down here. anyway,
 * remember to stick annoying sound effects into everything, like dying, and beating a level, oh, and clicking buttons. find/make (read: find) some new music,
 * uh, oh yeah, ADS ADS ADS. whole reason youre doing this, pretty much. also, remove debug logs and options, extra stuff, compress, etc, but thats obvious.
 * See if you can advertise for free somehow/somehere. Oh, and if you're not too bothered, maybe try fixing the distance/speed drawing issue. And the googly/following
 * eyes, figure that stuff out. Ok, bye for now. read this eventually please...
